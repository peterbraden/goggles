# Goggles #
Images for the command line


## Introduction ##

Ever find yourself ssh'd into a remote server wondering what some image looks like, and without an
easy way to look at it? You need *goggles*.

## Install ##

You'll need Cairo on your system.

Then:

        npm install -g goggles

## Use it ##

        $ goggles lenna.png --width 120

        $ cat mona.jpg | goggles

## Boom ##

(Please note, like with all goggles, you're gonna have to squint a bit)
